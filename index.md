# Introduction

Philips SpeechControl has been designed to control different applications on Windows computers with a Philips SpeechMike. You can load the latest firmware version into the active device and manage all the previous firmware versions.

The software allows to assign different functions to each button, enable or disable certain features, and also to control applications via hotkeys. 
For text generation, you can simply write the specified text with a button click into the text editor. 
Even more advanced, you can quickly execute your favorite Dragon NaturallySpeaking commands with just a button click on the device.

The device configuration settings can be transferred between the SpeechMike and the PC. 
You can also restore the default device configuration settings and upload them to the device.
When starting SpeechControl, the settings are automatically loaded from the connected active device. Changes made with other applications on the active device after the first startup are not downloaded to SpeechControl; you have to download them manually. If a device is already connected to the computer and you additionally connect another device, the second connected device becomes the active device. The device configuration settings will be loaded automatically.

The users can also export their preferred device settings and load them to a different device if a SpeechMike Premium, SpeechMike Premium Touch and SpeechMike Premium Air is connected. 
The SpeechMike Premium keyboard mode enables users to control applications like Dragon NaturallySpeaking with keyboard shortcuts without having to run SpeechControl in the background.
